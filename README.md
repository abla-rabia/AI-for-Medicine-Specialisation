# Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning

This repository contains the first assignment for the "AI for Medical Diagnosis" course. The project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using deep learning techniques and Keras. It uses transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification, addresses class imbalance, and evaluates diagnostic performance using AUROC and GradCAM visualizations.

## Features

- Data preparation, visualization, and leakage prevention
- Transfer learning with DenseNet121 for multi-label classification
- Class imbalance handling with weighted loss functions
- Evaluation using ROC curves and AUROC
- Model interpretability with GradCAM visualizations
